- "open sourced" children‘s book A Somewhat Different New Year
- basically 23 pages plus front & back in German (recommended) & English as pdfs
- github landing page based on [turnjs4](http://turnjs.com/) 🙏🏽 adding a mini script to auto-fill the book pages, few responsive media queries & an Easter egg of a humongous documentation 😋🎉
