            Being a 2nd-gen refugee female of color in tech can hurt e.g. with a CS male-female ratio of <a href="https://www.kit.edu/downloads/Statistik_WS2016.pdf">91:9</a> when I started but you really care about your parents, auntie, uncle & co being yelled at, made fun of, or insulted for the way we look and speak.

            There was a really cute zoo story for children on <a href="https://quran.com/en/an-nur/45">Surah An-Nur 24:45</a>: 
            <br><br>
            <code>"And Allah has created from water every living creature. Some of them crawl on their bellies, some walk on two legs, and some walk on four. Allah creates whatever He wills. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything."</code></p><code>

            🐧 <b>God has created such a wonderful world.</b> 
            <br><br>
            Creating, documenting & open sourcing this children's book "A Somewhat Different New Year" in this now world wide web carries the hope to reach through walls of narrow eyes in the littlest ways and celebrate a new age coming.

            Maybe the only person seriously interested in the book was Tom Nick bc he wanted to create his own. But hey a google dev with sleek projects like <a href="https://pokemoncries.com/">pokemoncries</a> asking about it, maybe "version controlling" and sharing how or how not to (children's) book here isn't too inadequate.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Marvellous Manyu</strong> 🖤 took care of all formalities like ISBN as well as the Chinese perspective. We sat across another during our amzn internship, so close 5y later spammed over night with "I have a sudden idea..." was simply met with "Oki let's do it" the next morning.</li>
            <li><strong>Super Huyen</strong> 👩🏼‍🚀 is our illustrator in Saigon wondrously connected through Upwork & working together <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/guide/">GitLab's all-remote</a> style.

        </ul>
        Biased to <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08GKYJVL1">work backwards</a>, in the beginning we alr imagined the book on an amzn detail page, in Asian supermarket chains, local Asian restaurants, spanning boundaries through network effects, randomly put on a bookstore shelf through guerilla stuff, and the like.

        None of this ever happened but it went...

        <h4>🛹 v0  Inspo (Nov19-)</h4>
        <p>
            There are so many new amazing children's books with people drawn other than the default "skin color" pencil, from good old <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/037583527X">Obama's Of Thee I Sing</a> over Hispanic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/0062839934/">Where a You From?</a> to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1638070628/">Native American Stories for Kids</a>, be it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/1951836340">The Birthday of the World</a> by a mystical rabbi's granddaughter or <a href ="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Ibtihaj-Muhammad/dp/0759555702">The Kindest Red</a> by a hijab-wearing olympic medalist last time checked!
            <br><br>
            There are so many adorable Western-Asian stories such as:
            <ul>
                <li><a href ="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1499808860">Grandpa Grumps'</a> "Daisy's Yeh-Yeh is visiting for the first time from China [...] but when Yeh-Yeh arrives, Daisy finds him less jolly than she imagined"</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0440417996">The Name Jar's</a> "Being the new kid in school is hard enough, but what happens when nobody can pronounce your name? Having just moved from Korea, Unhei is anxious about fitting in"</li>
                <li><a href ="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0881063363">The Ugly Vegetables'</a> "The neighbors' gardens look so much prettier and so much more inviting to the young gardener than the garden of "black-purple-green vines, fuzzy wrinkled leaves, prickly stems, and a few little yellow flowers" that she and her mother grow"</li>
                <li><a href ="https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/1623708036/r">A Different Pond</a> serves as main inspo with many details in the background like the hugging pillow (gối ôm) and Thi Bui's further adult graphic novel <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Best-We-Could-Do">The Best We Could Do</a> recommended by Kim's brother by Bill Gates was astonishing in that also non-Vietnamese people could be interested in Vietnamese stories</li>
                </ul>
            
            Overall, there are so many heartwarming reviews like "I am one of the FORTUNATE teachers that has “The United Nations” in my room. I make sure all races and cultures are covered for each of my students. They are in middle school, but they appreciate seeing all of the books".
        </p>

        <h4>🛴 v1 Drafting (Oct20-)</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://igormroz.com/documents/netflix_culture.pdf">Aligning highly</a>, reading books, strolling around bookstores, checking out kindle samples etc. as well as acknowledging our poetic limits and rather technical nature had the first draft flow naturally.</li>
                <li>It's been like merging the wonderful stories and past childhood memories of the elder together with acquiring or formalizing knowledge like traditional legends <a href="https://www.exoticvoyages.com/blog/the-story-banh-chung-34409.html">e.g. behind the Vietnamese new year's cake</a>, bowing that is #samesamebutdifferent after all, or basic vocabulary, and diving into latest developments like digital red envelopes, landmarks, or drone fireworks.</li>
                <li>Lastly, it's been fun to build an "mvp" by cutting out and glueing together the draft pages to form a mini mini book even including the ISBN barcode, hello artifact-based communication :-)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>🚲 v2 Production (Oct20-)</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Over continuous refinement and review sessions in the Google (, Upwork & Slack) workspace, the book took color and shape or final PDF format.</li>
                <li>Yay gotta catch 'em all, so now the sliced fruit of the Asian auntie, little grenade-injured dog with three legs, being forced to say hi to strange relatives over phone, cutting food with scissors (although it's unlucky over new year's sorry), jade bangle, wooden panel with agricultural workers, hugging pillow (thanks Thi Bui again), barefoot grandfather, manner of bowing, monkey for the jungle vs fancy asian distinction, secret Christian elements (or at least no non-Christian-elements), digital remittance, drone fireworks, and more are documented (now also along code that went to Mars kinda like the <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19690023536/downloads/19690023536.pdf">apollo 11 goodwill messages</a> ;-))!</li>
            </ul> 
        </p>
                
        <h4>🛺 v3 Release (Feb21)</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>You could see that our sample printing somehow failed (the output is zoomed in too much, format mismatch...) though <a href="https://www.wir-machen-druck.de/">wir-machen-druck</a> is great.</li>
                <li>But hey to this day we have the English ebook (and a vendor account hehe) on amazon which you shouldn't get because we share it here, also it's partly wrong :D So if we were ever to pick up professionally again, it's gonna be leapfrogging to a 2nd revised edition already (one should deffo get a literary editor).</li>
                <li>And hey back in that day, wonder still existed, so we had a book release party there and it's nice to see the book make it into some homes like Kim's sister's living room also projected to the wall :-)</li>
            </ul>          
        </p>       
        <h4>🪂 v4 Final (S)print (Feb24)</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>A lot has been going on like Manyu's internal transfer to Japan, Kim converting to theology, just Huyen has been jolly throughout :-), so it's this year that we picked up the book again.</li>
                <li>Finally, we got the idea to color print it out and bind it ourselves, so we could gift the book to our families after all even including some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vietnam-Envelopes-Vietnamese-Traditional-envelopes/dp/B0CNZTM26H?th=1">red envelopes</a> we always wanted to include! Amen ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ</li>

            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9MvdMqKvpU">That's what Pocahontas sang</a>: "You think I'm an ignorant savage and you've been so many places, I guess it must be so. But still, I cannot see if the savage one is me. How can there be so much that you don't know? [...] You think the only people who are people are the people who look and think like you. But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger, you'll learn things you never knew."

            This is just a small children's book by an expat between Hangzhou, the city of Alibaba, Munich & Tokyo, a young professional planted in developing Saigon, and a Swabian-Vietnamese refugee kid on “educational leave” just getting back from summer school with the Hebrew university of Jerusalem 1w before war broke out.

            A Filipina woman was cleaning the German embassy while we discussed theology and technology in the Silicon Valley of religions. Russian-Dutch Yandex-backed yango scooters with helmets lined up next to Asian-American Lime ones in front and opposite the street was another yellow yango darkstore. Also Tel Avivan Burmese served us sushi bc someone randomly craved it so I sent the Finnish Wolt logo at the door to a Vietnamese software friend at the Asian-American DoorDash parent in Tokyo.

            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4TNdopCyow">The world’s latest fastest and most energy-efficient supercomputer Frontier</a> “is able to perform more than one quintillion calculations per second. Now to put that performance in context, if each person on earth completed one calculation per second, it would take more than 4y to do what Frontier can do in 1 sec.”
