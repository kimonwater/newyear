            According to the professor it was being labeled <a href="https://www.kit.edu/kit/pi_2014_15510.php">exotic science</a> back in the 80s and deffo I was exotic studying at this wannabe mit aka karlsruhe institute of technology later.

            Being a 2nd-gen refugee female of color in tech can hurt e.g. with a CS male-female ratio of <a href="https://www.kit.edu/downloads/Statistik_WS2016.pdf">91:9</a> when I started but you really care about your parents, auntie, uncle &amp; co being yelled at, made fun of, or insulted for the way we look and speak.

            I really loved a zoo story for children on <a href="https://quran.com/en/an-nur/45">Surah An-Nur 24:45</a>:

            Creating, documenting &amp; open sourcing this children's book &quot;A Somewhat Different New Year&quot; in this now world wide web carries the hope to reach through walls of narrow eyes in the littlest ways and celebrate a new age coming.

            Maybe the only person seriously interested in the book was Tom Nick bc he wanted to create his own. But hey a google dev with sleek projects like <a href="https://pokemoncries.com/">pokemoncries</a> asking about it, maybe "version controlling" & sharing how/ not to (children's) book here isn't too inadequate.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Marvellous Manyu</strong> 🖤 took care of all formalities like ISBN as well as the Chinese perspective. We met sitting across each other during our amzn internship, so close I spammed her over night 5y later &quot;I have a sudden idea...&quot; to find her simply reply next morning &quot;Oki let's do it!&quot;.</li>

        </ul>
        Biased to <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08GKYJVL1">work backwards</a>, in the beginning we alr imagined the book reach out through an amzn detail page, Asian supermarket chains, local Asian restaurants, network effects through boundary-spanning friends, doing guerilla stuff like just putting it randomly into a bookstore shelf, or the like.
        <br><br>
        None of this ever happened but it went...

        <h4>🛹 v0  Inspo (Nov19-)</h4>
        <p>
            There are so many new amazing children's books with people drawn other than the default "skin color" pencil, from good old <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/037583527X">Obama's Of Thee I Sing</a> to Hispanic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/0062839934/">Where a You From?</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1638070628/">Native American Stories for Kids</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/1951836340">The Birthday of the World</a> by a mystical rabbi's granddaughter, or <a href ="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Ibtihaj-Muhammad/dp/0759555702">The Kindest Red</a> about wearing hijab last time checked!
            <br><br>
            The first graphic novel I picked up as adult was <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Best-We-Could-Do">The Best We Could Do</a> as recommended by my brother by Bill Gates which astonished me that also non-Vietnamese people could be interested in Vietnamese stories. Thi Bui's later actual children's book <a href ="https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/1623708036/r">A Different Pond</a> with many details in the background like the hugging pillow (gối ôm) serves as main inspo. 
            <br><br>
            There are so many adorable Western-Asian stories like <a href ="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1499808860">Grandpa Grumps'</a> "Daisy's Yeh-Yeh is visiting for the first time from China [...] but when Yeh-Yeh arrives, Daisy finds him less jolly than she imagined", <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0440417996">The Name Jar's</a> "Being the new kid in school is hard enough, but what happens when nobody can pronounce your name? Having just moved from Korea, Unhei is anxious about fitting in", or <a href ="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0881063363">The Ugly Vegetables'</a> "The neighbors' gardens look so much prettier and so much more inviting to the young gardener than the garden of "black-purple-green vines, fuzzy wrinkled leaves, prickly stems, and a few little yellow flowers" that she and her mother grow". 
            <br><br> 
            Overall, there are also so many heartwarming reviews like "I am one of the FORTUNATE teachers that has “The United Nations” in my room. I make sure all races and cultures are covered for each of my students. They are in middle school, but they appreciate seeing all of the books".
        </p>


        
        <h4>🛴 v1 Drafting (Oct20-)</h4>
        <p>
            <a href="https://igormroz.com/documents/netflix_culture.pdf">Aligning highly</a>, reading books, strolling around bookstores, checking out kindle samples etc. as well as acknowledging our poetic limits and rather technical nature had the first draft flow naturally. 
            <br><br>
            It's been like merging the wonderful stories and past childhood memories of the elder together with acquiring or formalizing knowledge like traditional legends <a href="https://www.exoticvoyages.com/blog/the-story-banh-chung-34409.html">e.g. behind the Vietnamese new year's cake</a>, #samesamebutdifferent bowing, or basic vocabulary, and diving into latest developments like digital red envelopes, landscapes, or drone fireworks. 
            <br><br>
            Lastly, it's been fun to build an "mvp" by cutting out and glueing together the draft pages to form a mini mini book even including the ISBN barcode, hello artifact-based communication :-)
        </p>

        <h4>🚲 v2 Production (Oct20-)</h4>
        <p>
            Yay over continuous refinement and review sessions in the Google (, Upwork & Slack) workspace, the book took color and shape or final PDF format.  
            <br><br>
            We gotta catch 'em all so now the sliced fruit of the Asian auntie, little grenade-injured dog with three legs, being forced to say hi to strange relatives over phone, cutting food with scissors (although it's unlucky over new year's sorry), jade bangle, wooden panel with four agricultural workers, hugging pillow (thanks Thi Bui again), barefoot grandfather, bowing, monkey for the jungle vs fancy asian distinction, secret Christian elements (or at least no non-Christian-elements), digital remittance, drone fireworks, and more are documented (now also along code that went to Mars kinda like the <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19690023536/downloads/19690023536.pdf">apollo 11 goodwill messages</a> ;-))! </p>
        </p>
                
        <h4>🛺 v3 Release (Feb21)</h4>
        <p>
            You could see that our sample printing somehow failed (the output is zoomed in too much as the formats are mismatching) (we chose <a href="https://www.wir-machen-druck.de/">wir-machen-druck</a>, they are super cool). 
            <br><br>
            But hey to this day we have the English ebook (and a vendor account hehe) on amazon which you shouldn't get because we open sourced it here, also it's partly wrong :D So if we were ever to pick up professionally again, it's gonna be leapfrogging to a 2nd revised edition already (one should deffo get a literary editor). 
            <br><br>
            And hey back in that day, wonder still even existed, so we had a book release party there and it's nice to see the book make it into some homes like my sister's living room even projected to the wall :-) 
        </p>       
        <h4>🪂 v4 Final (S)print (Feb24)</h4>
        <p>
            A lot has been going on like Manyu's internal transfer to Japan, Kim converting to theology, well Huyen has been jolly throughout :-), so it's this year that we picked up on the book again. 
            <br><br>
            "Serendipitously", we got the idea to just color print it out and bind it ourselves, so we could finally gift the book to our families even including some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vietnam-Envelopes-Vietnamese-Traditional-envelopes/dp/B0CNZTM26H?th=1">red envelopes</a> we always wanted to include! Amen ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ</a>

            "You think I'm an ignorant savage and you've been so many places, I guess it must be so. But still, I cannot see if the savage one is me. How can there be so much that you don't know? [...] You think the only people who are people are the people who look and think like you. But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger, you'll learn things you never knew", <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9MvdMqKvpU">that's what Pocahontas sang.</a>

            This is just a small children's book by an expat between Hangzhou, the city of Alibaba, Munich & Tokyo, a young professional planted in developing Saigon, and a Swabian-Vietnamese refugee kid on “educational leave” just getting back from summer school with the Hebrew university of Jerusalem 1w before war broke out.

            A Filipina woman was cleaning the German embassy while we discussed theology and technology in the Silicon Valley of religions. Russian-Dutch Yandex-backed yango scooters with helmets lined up next to Asian-American Lime ones in front and opposite the street was another yellow yango darkstore. Tel Avivan Burmese served us sushi bc someone randomly craved it so I sent the Finnish Wolt logo at the door to a Vietnamese software friend at the Asian-American DoorDash parent in Tokyo.

            The UK‘s passed away <a href="https://www.firstthings.com/article/2014/01/on-creative-minorities">chief rabbi Jonathan Sachs discussed</a> passed away <a href="https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=6317">pope Benedict discussing</a> the West passing away, nationalists believe their nations degenerate (à la "Deutschland schafft sich ab"),  and we’ve heard the old stories about poor dogs, disruptive innovation, bloody red oceans, or Day 2 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/04/21/what-is-jeff-bezos-day-1-philosophy/?sh=42cb17d91052">"stasis.

            A structural change is taking place indeed.

            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4TNdopCyow">The world’s latest fastest and most energy efficient supercomputer Frontier</a> “is able to perform more than one quintillion calculations per second. Now to put that performance in context, if each person on earth completed one calculation per second, it would take more than 4y to do what Frontier can do in 1 sec.”

            “AMD inside”, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Ji1JXCqdU">Lisa Su further explains</a>: “The world is full of very complex and challenging problems. [...] So my favorite advice to graduates is find the toughest problems in the world and volunteer to help solve them [...] This is when you're really doing something that makes a difference."

            Here’s to crossing new frontiers, pushing the envelope across borders, and a future in which even today’s war-torn children, their children, and their children, will have their own fav childhood movie memories and write their own most simple, stupid children’s books! ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ
